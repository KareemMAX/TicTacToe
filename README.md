A command line Tic-Tac-Toe game with AI.

## About

This Tic-Tac-Toe AI was made as a challenge with my friends to make the best one. This version was implemented with my knowledge without resorting to any Tic-Tac-Toe pre-made AI algorithm or even google searching so it might be quiet rough but I tried my best üòÅ.

It should win most games.
